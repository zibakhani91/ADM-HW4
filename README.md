# ADM-HW4-group6

In this assignment we have analyzed data which we collected from the website immobiliare.it. Input file is uploaded on github repository.
Data contains information about announcements for selling the houses, Description, Price, Surface, Rooms, Bathrooms and Floor.
In the Task 1, we performed clustering using Kmeans++ methodology on Description and the rest of the information separately. Then we used Jaccard Similarity to measure distance between 2 set of clusters. For the top 3 similar clusters, we made word cloud.
In the Task 2, we implemented our hash function and applied it to the given input file. Using our result, we were able to count duplicates from the input file. We were also able to count how many collisions (false positives).
